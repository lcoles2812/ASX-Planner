	<h1>The Importance of Investing and Compound Interest</h1>
	<p>Investing is a powerful tool that can help you achieve your long-term financial goals. By investing your money wisely, you can potentially earn higher returns than you would with a savings account or other low-risk investments.</p>
	<p>One of the key benefits of investing is compound interest. Compound interest is the interest earned on both the principal amount and the interest already earned. In other words, it's interest on top of interest. This can help your investments grow exponentially over time, as the interest you earn is reinvested and earns even more interest.</p>
	<h2>How Compound Interest Works</h2>
	<p>Let's take a closer look at how compound interest works with 2 different scenarios. Say you invest $10,000 in a stock with a annual rate of return of 10% from the age of 20 to 30, this total investment would be $100,000. The other scenario is investing $10,000 a year starting from the age of 30 for 20 years with a total investment of $200,000 double that of scenario 1. 
        This table emphasises importance of starting early rather than the amount you invest in total.</p>

	<p>As you can see, the longer you stay invested and reinvest your earnings, the more your money can grow.</p>
	<p>Investing does come with risks, however. It's important to do your research and understand the potential risks before making any investments. It's also important to diversify your investments to spread out your risk and potentially earn higher returns.</p>
	<p>Overall, investing and compound interest can be powerful tools for building long-term wealth. By starting early, staying invested, and making smart investment decisions, you can potentially grow your money and achieve your financial goals.</p>
